                Hi, I’m <strong>Sahil Phalke</strong>, a passionate and curious Computer Engineering student currently in my final year. I enjoy exploring different aspects of technology, from programming and problem-solving to working on practical mini-projects. I’m always eager to learn and apply what I know to real-world challenges.
                <br><br>
                Apart from academics, I believe in staying active and creative. I enjoy playing <strong>badminton</strong> and have won several prizes in competitions. I also like expressing my creative side — recently, I secured <strong>2nd place</strong> in an inter-college reel-making competition, which helped me discover a new interest in digital content creation.
                <br><br>
                Whether it’s through code, creativity, or collaboration, I aim to keep growing both personally and professionally. I’m open to opportunities that help me learn, contribute, and make a positive impact.
              </p>
